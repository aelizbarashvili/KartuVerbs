* id: Id in Clarino database to keep link to the corresponding croot.

The objective of the project is to develop a model that can predict the Verbal Noun based on the provided information, including the form, tense_in_paradigm, person, number, preverb, pre2, root, sf2, caus_sf, ending, tsch_class, morph_type, id and sub_id.
